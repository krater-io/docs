## Price Tiers

As a hosting provider, it's essential to have mechanisms in place that incentivize your customers. The "Price Tiers" feature is an excellent tool for accomplishing this. 

When creating a "Location," you're prompted to provide a base kWh rate. For instance, if your rate is $0.04 per kWh, you can then go to the "Price Tiers" section and create one or more tiers. Hereâ€™s an example:

1. **Bronze Tier** - Priced at $0.08 per kWh.
2. **Silver Tier** - Priced at $0.07 per kWh.
3. **Gold Tier** - Priced at $0.065 per kWh.

These "Price Tiers" can then be assigned to your "Customers" based on certain factors, for example:

1. **Bronze Tier** - Applied to 0-300 kW consumption.
2. **Silver Tier** - Applied to 300-1000 kW consumption.
3. **Gold Tier** - Applied to 1000-3000 kW consumption.

By implementing this strategy, you can incentivize your existing customers to expand their hardware fleet. However, it's important to note that these price tiers only apply to customers to whom they have been assigned. Therefore, keeping track of these assignments is crucial in the effective management of your pricing strategy.
