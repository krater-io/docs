3. Create a Krater Node (it’s still called “data agent” inside the dashboard) by selecting the location associated with it.

4. Click on Install and follow the instructions. You need to copy the command and execute it from Terminal on Ubuntu or Debian. At the end of the process you’ll be required to paste the ID to associate Krater Node with the Location.
