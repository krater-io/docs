The dashboard is a centralized hub providing essential information and functionalities related to mining operations. It offers key statistics, revenue, and profit metrics for hosting providers to facilitate informed decision-making processes.

The hosting provider's dashboard comprises the following elements:

**Dropdown Filters**
	- *Algorithms:* Most proof-of-work algorithms are supported (e.g., SHA-256, Equihash, X11, Scrypt). Default value - all.
	- *Location:* The desired location for displaying statistics. Default value - all.
	- *Container:* Specific container within a location (applicable only if containers were added before). Default value - all.

**Tabs**
	- *Power:* Displays nominal and actual values for real-time energy consumption.
	- *Hashrate:* Shows nominal and actual values for real-time hashrate.
	- *Uptime:* Displays the workers' uptime.
	- *Customers' Debt:* Indicates the amount of USDT owed by customers for hosting payments (Only applicable if invoicing feature is enabled).

**Charts**

**Statistics**
	- *Power:* Chart showing detailed energy consumption for the last 24 hours. Includes minimum, average, and maximum values.
	- *Hashrate:* Chart depicting the computational power for mining cryptocurrency over the past 24 hours. It includes minimum, average, and maximum hashrate values.
	- *Temperature:* Shows temperature variations over the last 24 hours, including minimum, average, and maximum values.

**Krater Nodes**
	- *Node name:* This is a user-input field for node identification.
	- *Version:* This reflects the software version for each node.
