**Krater Node** is the piece of software making up the **Krater** stack that runs **locally** inside the network of a location and serves as a **link between the workers/miners and our backend**. 

On **Krater**, each Location has a **Krater Node ID** associated to it. Each **Krater Node** runs locally and is associated with the corresponding **ID**. This association happens during the installation process of Krater Node locally when the user is asked to paste the **Krater Node ID** with which the local instance will be associated.

The user can install more than one instance of **Krater Node** locally, thus having more than one location monitored from the same machine. The only requirement is that the computer running these **Krater Node** instances needs to have access to the LANs of each of the locations (via physical ethernet connection, VPN, etc…).

Once the **Krater Node** is installed locally, the user can see this by navigating to the Locations menu and clicking on the Krater Node button of the **Location** that was associated. The screen will show “**Activated**” and a “**Last Online**” time of less than 5min. If the “Last Online” time is **above 5min** and this doesn’t change after refreshing the page, then your **Krater Node** local instance might have lost connection to the internet or there might be some other issue
