## Sitemap's Role

Cryptocurrency mining operations rely on robust management and monitoring systems as the number of mining hardware arrays grows within data centers. This is where Krater's 'Sitemap' capability provides indispensable support. 

A Sitemap is a visual representation of the physical layout of a mining data center. It denotes the precise locations of miners and racks, allowing users to monitor the temperature, status of miners, and their physical location using identifiers such as name, IP, or MAC address. Heat maps are an integral part of Sitemaps and aid in identifying potential cooling problem areas.

### Benefits

Sitemaps radically enhance the management and monitoring of large-scale cryptocurrency mining operations. By offering a clear overview of an entire data center's layout, they simplify the process of identifying and resolving operational issues. They further aid in optimizing miner and rack placement for optimal performance.

In terms of security, Sitemaps also enable users to track each miner's physical location, proving beneficial in cases of theft or unauthorized data center access.

### Krater's Sitemap

Krater extends a comprehensive Sitemap feature for its users. It enables creating a detailed floor plan within the platform, inclusive of a heat map to mark hot and cold spots in the layout. It also allows users to locate a miner using identifying credentials such as name, IP, or MAC address.

Click on the "Sitemap" tab in the left menu and look for the "Add Rack" button. You will be prompted to enter the rack name, location, container (if previously created), description, rack length, and height. After that you will need to select workers that will be added to that rack, confirm the selection and the rack will be added.
