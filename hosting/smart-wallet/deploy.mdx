6. To create the wallet, you will need to provide your signature. This transaction occurs on the blockchain, but we subsidize the transactions for our users so that they do not have to pay for gas fees. Your signature will be sufficient.
    
<Frame caption="Metamask extension will pop up and ask for a signature, click “Sign” to proceed."><img height="200" src="images/smart-wallet-deployment/signature.png" /></Frame>
    
7. Congratulations! Your Smart-Wallet has been created and deployed to the Polygon Blockchain. You can now use your wallet to start interacting with Krater.
