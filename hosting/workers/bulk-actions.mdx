Running mining operations on a larger scale requires the ability to perform various tasks en masse. Our bulk actions feature provides all the necessary functionalities you require in one tool.

**Actions**

1. **Bulk Restart**: This action allows you to restart multiple mining workers simultaneously. It eliminates the need to manually restart each worker, saving time and effort.

2. **Bulk Turn Off Hash Power**: With this feature, you can disable the hash power of multiple workers at once. Use this to pause mining activity when needed without affecting each worker individually.

3. **Bulk Turn On Hash Power**: This function will enable the hash power of numerous workers simultaneously. Itâ€™s useful when you want to resume mining operations after a pause.

4. **Bulk Change Owner of Workers**: Use this feature to change the ownership of multiple workers to a new owner simultaneously. This will be useful during ownership transitions or reassignments.

5. **Bulk Change Location of Workers**: This feature is helpful when you want to change the recorded location details of multiple workers at a time, such as after a physical move of your setup.

6. **Bulk Change Container of Workers**: This action allows you to change the container details of several workers simultaneously. This can support organizational changes or re-structuring of your mining infrastructure.

7. **Bulk Remove Workers**: Use this function when you need to remove multiple miners from your system at once. It aids in managing your setup, allowing you to maintain only the currently active and necessary miners.

8. **Bulk Change Pool**: This feature lets you change the mining pool for multiple workers in bulk. Use this when changing mining strategies or when a different pool offers better rewards or lower fees.

With these capabilities, you can efficiently manage your workers and tailor the interface to fit your operational needs.
