2. Go to the Non-Custodial Exchange platform [Changenow](https://changenow.io) and select the cryptocurrency you want to "Send". For this guide, we will use Bitcoin (BTC) as the cryptocurrency to "Send", and select USDT (Polygon) as the cryptocurrency to "Get". Then, press the "Exchange" button. (BEWARE) Do not send any other crypto, Smart-Wallet only supports USDT on Polygon.

<Frame caption="Changenow offers various exchange directions. Always choose to 'Get' USDT on Polygon if you are sending directly to your Smart-Wallet. Do not send anything else, Krater only supports USDT on Polygon"><img height="200" src="https://github.com/krater-io/docs/blob/main/images/deposit-with-exchange/go-to-changenow.jpg?raw=true" /></Frame>

3. You will now see the exchange details and will be prompted to enter the "Recipient Address". This address should be the Smart-Wallet address that you copied previously from Krater's Balance page. Paste the address and click "Next".

6. Once you have sent the cryptocurrency, the status of the order will change from "Awaiting Deposit" to "Confirming". When your transaction reaches the required number of confirmations, the exchange will be completed. Now, you just need to wait.

7. Congratulations! You have successfully completed the exchange, and USDT (Polygon) has been sent to the "Recipient Address", which in this case is the "Smart-Wallet" address.
